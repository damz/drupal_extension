 This extension adds C implementations to the frequently used Drupal check_plain and drupal_static functions.

 drupal_static is still experimental and it should not be used in production until you've thoroughly tested it.
 It has only been tested to work with PHP 5.3.2, however, it should work with PHP 5.2 as well.
 Test with a new Drupal installation first. If something goes wrong with drupal_static, you should know it right away,
 since Drupal will break if it's malfunctioning.

 Benchmarking information is included in the benchmarks directory.

 INSTALLATION:
 1) Run phpize in the extension's directory.
 2) Run ./configure;make;make test;make install
 3) Uncomment the check_plain and drupal_static functions in includes/bootstrap.inc in Drupal's directory. 
    *do not* uncomment the drupal_static_reset() function.
 4) Restart your web server for the changes to take effect. 

 Does this extension work for you?
 Please report success or failure to dhthwy@gmail.com and include your PHP version. phpinfo() output will be useful too.
